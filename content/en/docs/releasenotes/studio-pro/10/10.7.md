### New Features
    
#### Conditional Editability on Data Views 

We introduced conditional editability for data views. This means that when all the input fields within a data view are editable based on the same condition, you no longer need to repeat that condition for every input field. You can now specify that condition on the data view level instead.

When conditional editability conditions are nested (for example an input field inside a conditional editable data view, or nested data views with conditional editability conditions) then the conditions are combined.

This is based on an [idea from Marco Bouwkamp](https://forum.mendix.com/link/space/app-development/ideas/1668) submitted to the Mendix Idea Forum. Thanks, Marco!

#### React Client

In keeping with our commitment to delivering the best maker experience possible, we are excited to introduce our new web client. This client is built entirely using React.js, a modern JavaScript library known for its efficiency and flexibility. The React client is available as a public beta and will be generally available in Mendix 10.12. For more information on what a beta release is, see [Beta and Experimental releases](/releasenotes/beta-features/).

#### Version Control: Aligning Merge Update Flow with Rebase

We aligned the merge flow with the rebase experience when you use update. Now both ways of updating are handled and managed by notification bars with similar controls.
For more information on these actions and their differences, see [Combining Changes and Conflict Resolution](/refguide/merge-algorithm/).

#### Studio Pro on Mac (Beta)

Studio Pro on Mac is now in [Public Beta](/releasenotes/beta-features/). This allows you to run Studio Pro natively on Mac without Parallels. With the Mac version of Studio Pro, you can edit your apps on Windows using the functionality you are used to.

Known limitations:

* No native mobile support
* No support for document templates
* No **Structure mode** for the page editor

Known bugs:
* The search in the app explorer does not work yet. Please use CMD + G to search for documents
* If you have already installed JDK previously it may not be picked up properly during installation. Either configure this manually or remove all references to JDK and run the installer again.
* The installer is currently not yet notarized, so you need to run it using right click > Open to be able to bypass the dialog

#### Workflow Events 

We added a mechanism to register microflows as event handlers for events that occur to workflows. The event handler microflows are provided with detailed workflow data that can be used to create audit trails, performance diagrams, or for analytical purposes.

### Improvements
    
* [Logic Bot](/refguide/mx-assist-logic-bot/) now supports parameter matching for the **Show Page** activity.
* We introduced the new selection property for the pluggable widgets API which allows widgets to read and set selections that can be used in actions, expressions, or a **Listen to** data source of a data view.
* We changed the keyboard support in MendixChat for building and sending a prompt. <kbd>Enter</kbd> sends while <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> adds a new line. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> works in the same way as <kbd>Enter</kbd>, because <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is not taken into account anymore.
* We added a **New chat** button to the top bar of MendixChat which allows the user to clear messages from the chat.
* We added a copy option to MendixChat which allows you to copy the given answer to a clipboard.
* We added useful information about the referenced documents in MendixChat. You can now see the Mendix version of the references, the level required if the reference comes from Mendix Academy, and the date and answer status if the reference comes from Mendix Forum.
* When selecting a REST request for a **REST request** microflow activity, you can now select **New** to directly create a new REST request.
* Consumed REST Service now supports variables in request headers.
* We block the Rebase feature in the case where the installed Git version is below 2.41.
* When moving documents that have roles configured for them (for example, roles like pages or microflows) to a different module, we now try and re-map the configured roles to roles with the same name from the module that you are moving the documents to.
* We improved the scaling of the new access rule editor when expanding the view.
* We improved the scroll behavior in the new access rule editor. Next to this we made various small improvements to focus, selection, and ordering in the user interface.
* When a data view listens to a pluggable widget while you are in **Design mode**, an overlay icon and proper selection highlighting are now shown on both widgets.
* We now support HTTP Method `PATCH` in a consumed REST service (beta).
* We introduced an "application/json" as the default 'accept' header in a consumed REST service (beta). The 'accept' header helps the server know what response content type can be understood by the client application.
* Published OData services can now be hosted on any location path, not just `/odata`.
* The [list of published OData services](/refguide/published-odata-services/#61-general) on `/odata-doc` now shows the [service names](/refguide/published-odata-services/#21-service-name) instead of locations of the services.
* We moved the **Send external object** and **Delete external object** activities to the **Integration activities** category in the microflow **Toolbox**.
* We upgraded the Azure Blob Storage dependency from 8.6.6 to 12.25.1.
* We improved the error messages that are logged when the number of users exceeds the licensed amount.
* We updated the Data Importer module to read, parse, and import CSV (comma separated values) files. The existing Data Importer menu can be used to configure your CSV files. The configured settings can be utilized with the existing [Import data from file](/refguide/import-data-from-file/) activity.
* External database connector now supports UPDATE & DELETE SQL statements.
* We improved the performance of populating tables and views metadata from all schemas accessible by the user in External Database Connector. Searching for information within this tab was also improved.
* External Database Connector has a new SQL Query text box which offers highlighting of SQL grammar, and retains indentation and formatting after being pasted into the component. It also now supports standard features such as copy, paste, undo, redo, find, and replace.

### Fixes

* <a id="fix-breakpoint"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.6/#ki-breakpoint) where breakpoints were not updating.
* <a id="fix-first-time"></a>We fixed a [known issue](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.6/#ki-first-time) where a user opened MendixChat for the first time and had to click **Sign in** even though they were already signed in to Studio Pro. 
* We fixed an issue where the last row did not get imported from the Excel to the **Batch Translate** dialog box. (Tickets 199182, 202693)

* We fixed an issue with selecting an association for a pluggable widget, for example the **Combo box** widget, inside a snippet with multiple parameters. (Ticket 204133)
* We fixed an issue in which navigating back in history caused a **Combo box** widget using an association to break. (Tickets 205378, 205479)
* We fixed an issue where MxBuild threw an exception when there was a consistency error in the mapping document. (Ticket 203311)
* We fixed the OpenAPI 2.0 (*swagger.json*) contract for published REST services, where having a list parameter to an operation resulted in an invalid *swagger.json* file (Ticket 203643).
* We fixed an issue with external entities where XPath constraints using the `contains` function with an empty search term resulted in an error. (Ticket 204392)
* We fixed an issue where you would get a NullPointerException due to specific Java dependencies at the startup of an app. (Ticket 203262)
* We reintroduced the fix for the issue where created files were not deleted when an error occurs in a microflow. (Ticket 199712)
* We fixed a problem where using the setting **Public application root URL** without an explicitly specified protocol (for example "example.com" instead of "http://example.com/ ") was causing issues. (Ticket 197968)

* We improved performance of dangling reference cleanup procedure on a first run of a new app.
* Using an empty collection in the Java APIs `XPathQuery.setVariable` or `IParameterMap.putCollection` no longer results in invalid SQL being generated.
* We now validate the attribute names of business events on creation to avoid having the same name as an attribute from the generalization entities.
* We fixed an issue in the microflow editor where the output variable on a **Cast object** activity was not set to the correct entity.
* We fixed an issue in the logic editors where the return type of a list operation showed **(Not set)** when predefined variables were used.
* We fixed an issue where an error was shown when trying to modify entity members through the **Change object** microflow action.

* We fixed an issue witth the schema import wizard for published web services in Studio Pro on MacOS.
* We corrected the `@context` URL that is returned for OData actions that returned an object or a list of objects. This now points to the entity type metadata instead of that of the entity set.
* We fixed an error that occurred when consuming an OData contract that contained an action using an entity that was not exposed through an entity set. We now display these actions as having an unsupported parameter or return type.
* We fixed an issue in the Swagger UI interactive documentation pages for published REST and OData services. These pages no longer allow configuration to be set via query parameters.
* We fixed an issue in the domain model editor where undoing changes to the domain model could cause an **Oops** pop-up window to appear when making new changes.
* We reintroduced the improvement that updates the `changedBy` attribute when `storeFileDocumentContent` or `storeImageDocumentContent` from the Mendix Runtime API is used, or when uploading files. This makes it consistent with other ways of updating file documents or images.
* We improved handling of errors that can occur when committing `FileDocument`s.
* We corrected the result of the getMetaInfo method when called on a RetrieveIdListAction.
* We fixed the issue in workflows in which the failure reason of an activity is overwritten by a subsequent abort. A failed activity is no longer aborted, but stays failed.

### Deprecations   

* We removed the legacy microflow editor.

### Known Issues

* Studio Pro might crash when using the new expression editor in combination with accessibility tools (for example, enabling the text cursor indicator).
    * Workaround: You can switch back to the old editor via **Preferences** > [New Features](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#new-features).
* The new expression editor does not work well with non-ASCII characters.
    * Workaround: You can switch back to the old editor via **Preferences** > [New Features](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#new-features).
* Line endings in CSS files are not being handled properly, so when using [Revert All Changes](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/) or performing other version-control operations, CSS files appear in the [Changes on Disk](/refguide/version-control-menu/#show-changes) dialog box.
    * Workaround: For details, see [this section](/refguide/troubleshoot-version-control-issues/#css-error) in *Troubleshooting Version Control*.
* A finished parallel split path that is removed from a running workflow instance wrongly leads to a versioning conflict. Please note that "path" was called "branch" in earlier versions.
